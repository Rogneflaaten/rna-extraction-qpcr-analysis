	abstract = {The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of two different high-intensity interval training (HIT) programs on selected aerobic physiological indices and 1500 and 5000 m running performance in well-trained runners. The following tests were completed (n = 17): (i) incremental treadmill test to determine maximal oxygen uptake (VO
              2 max
              ), running velocity associated with VO
              2 max
              (vVO
              2 max
              ), and the velocity corresponding to 3.5 mmol/L of blood lactate concentration (vOBLA); (ii) submaximal constant-intensity test to determine running economy (RE); and (iii) 1500 and 5000 m time trials on a 400 m track. Runners were then randomized into 95\% vVO
              2 max
              or 100\% vVO
              2 max
              groups, and undertook a 4 week training program consisting of 2 HIT sessions (performed at 95\% or 100\% vVO
              2 max
              , respectively) and 4 submaximal run sessions per week. Runners were retested on all parameters at the completion of the training program. The VO
              2 max
              values were not different after training for both groups. There was a significant increase in post-training vVO
              2 max
              , RE, and 1500 m running performance in the 100\% vVO
              2 max
              group. The vOBLA and 5000 m running performance were significantly higher after the training period for both groups. We conclude that vOBLA and 5000 m running performance can be significantly improved in well-trained runners using a 4 week training program consisting of 2 HIT sessions (performed at 95\% or 100\% vVO
              2 max
              ) and 4 submaximal run sessions per week. However, the improvement in vVO
              2 max
              , RE, and 1500 m running performance seems to be dependent on the HIT program at 100\% vVO
              2 max
              .},

	abstract = {Human endurance performance can be predicted from maximal oxygen consumption (V̇o
              2max
              ), lactate threshold, and exercise efficiency. These physiological parameters, however, are not wholly exclusive from one another, and their interplay is complex. Accordingly, we sought to identify more specific measurements explaining the range of performance among athletes. Out of 150 separate variables we identified 10 principal factors responsible for hematological, cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and neurological variation in 16 highly trained cyclists. These principal factors were then correlated with a 26-km time trial and test of maximal incremental power output. Average power output during the 26-km time trial was attributed to, in order of importance, oxidative phosphorylation capacity of the vastus lateralis muscle ( P = 0.0005), steady-state submaximal blood lactate concentrations ( P = 0.0017), and maximal leg oxygenation (sO
              2LEG
              ) ( P = 0.0295), accounting for 78\% of the variation in time trial performance. Variability in maximal power output, on the other hand, was attributed to total body hemoglobin mass (Hb
              mass
              ; P = 0.0038), V̇o
              2max
              ( P = 0.0213), and sO
              2LEG
              ( P = 0.0463). In conclusion, 1) skeletal muscle oxidative capacity is the primary predictor of time trial performance in highly trained cyclists; 2) the strongest predictor for maximal incremental power output is Hb
              mass
              ; and 3) overall exercise performance (time trial performance + maximal incremental power output) correlates most strongly to measures regarding the capability for oxygen transport, high V̇o
              2max
              and Hb
              mass
              , in addition to measures of oxygen utilization, maximal oxidative phosphorylation, and electron transport system capacities in the skeletal muscle.},

              2
              and rebreathed for a specified time period, during which most of the CO is absorbed and bound to circulating hemoglobin. The dilution principle then allows calculation of the total number of circulating hemoglobin molecules based on the number of absorbed CO molecules and the resulting changes in the fraction of carboxyhemoglobin in blood. Total hemoglobin mass is derived by multiplication with the molar weight of hemoglobin. CO rebreathing has been used for {\textgreater}100 yr and has undergone steady improvement so that today excellent values in terms of accuracy and precision can be achieved if the methodological precautions are carefully followed.},

In exercise and sports-science research and routine testing, internal validity is commonly achieved by controlling variables such as exercise and warm-up protocols, prior training, nutritional intake before testing, ambient temperature, time of testing, hours of sleep, age, and gender. However, a number of other potential confounding variables often do not receive adequate attention in sports physiology and performance research. These confounding variables include instructions on how to perform the test, volume and frequency of verbal encouragement, knowledge of exercise endpoint, number and gender of observers in the room, influence of music played before and during testing, and the effects of mental fatigue on performance. In this review the authors discuss these variables in relation to common testing environments in exercise and sports science and present some recommendations with the goal of reducing possible threats to internal validity.},

	abstract = {The replication (replicability, reproducibility) crisis in social psychology and clinical medicine arises from the fact that many apparently well-confirmed experimental results are subsequently overturned by studies that aim to replicate the original study. The culprit is widely held to be poor science: questionable research practices, failure to publish negative results, bad incentives, and even fraud. In this article I argue that the high rate of failed replications is consistent with high-quality science. We would expect this outcome if the field of science in question produces a high proportion of false hypotheses prior to testing. If most of the hypotheses under test are false, then there will be many false hypotheses that are apparently supported by the outcomes of well conducted experiments and null hypothesis significance tests with a type-I error rate (α) of 5\%. Failure to recognize this is to commit the fallacy of ignoring the base rate. I argue that this is a plausible diagnosis of the replication crisis and examine what lessons we thereby learn for the future conduct of science.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of two different high-intensity interval training (HIT) programs on selected aerobic physiological indices and 1500 and 5000 m running performance in well-trained runners. The following tests were completed (n = 17): (i) incremental treadmill test to determine maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max ), running velocity associated with VO 2 max (vVO 2 max ), and the velocity corresponding to 3.5 mmol/L of blood lactate concentration (vOBLA); (ii) submaximal constant-intensity test to determine running economy (RE); and (iii) 1500 and 5000 m time trials on a 400 m track. Runners were then randomized into 95\% vVO 2 max or 100\% vVO 2 max groups, and undertook a 4 week training program consisting of 2 HIT sessions (performed at 95\% or 100\% vVO 2 max , respectively) and 4 submaximal run sessions per week. Runners were retested on all parameters at the completion of the training program. The VO 2 max values were not different after training for both groups. There was a significant increase in post-training vVO 2 max , RE, and 1500 m running performance in the 100\% vVO 2 max group. The vOBLA and 5000 m running performance were significantly higher after the training period for both groups. We conclude that vOBLA and 5000 m running performance can be significantly improved in well-trained runners using a 4 week training program consisting of 2 HIT sessions (performed at 95\% or 100\% vVO 2 max ) and 4 submaximal run sessions per week. However, the improvement in vVO 2 max , RE, and 1500 m running performance seems to be dependent on the HIT program at 100\% vVO 2 max .},

	abstract = {Human endurance performance can be predicted from maximal oxygen consumption (V̇o 2max ), lactate threshold, and exercise efficiency. These physiological parameters, however, are not wholly exclusive from one another, and their interplay is complex. Accordingly, we sought to identify more specific measurements explaining the range of performance among athletes. Out of 150 separate variables we identified 10 principal factors responsible for hematological, cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and neurological variation in 16 highly trained cyclists. These principal factors were then correlated with a 26-km time trial and test of maximal incremental power output. Average power output during the 26-km time trial was attributed to, in order of importance, oxidative phosphorylation capacity of the vastus lateralis muscle ( P = 0.0005), steady-state submaximal blood lactate concentrations ( P = 0.0017), and maximal leg oxygenation (sO 2LEG ) ( P = 0.0295), accounting for 78\% of the variation in time trial performance. Variability in maximal power output, on the other hand, was attributed to total body hemoglobin mass (Hb mass ; P = 0.0038), V̇o 2max ( P = 0.0213), and sO 2LEG ( P = 0.0463). In conclusion, 1) skeletal muscle oxidative capacity is the primary predictor of time trial performance in highly trained cyclists; 2) the strongest predictor for maximal incremental power output is Hb mass ; and 3) overall exercise performance (time trial performance + maximal incremental power output) correlates most strongly to measures regarding the capability for oxygen transport, high V̇o 2max and Hb mass , in addition to measures of oxygen utilization, maximal oxidative phosphorylation, and electron transport system capacities in the skeletal muscle.},

With CO rebreathing, a small quantity of CO is diluted in O 2 and rebreathed for a specified time period, during which most of the CO is absorbed and bound to circulating hemoglobin. The dilution principle then allows calculation of the total number of circulating hemoglobin molecules based on the number of absorbed CO molecules and the resulting changes in the fraction of carboxyhemoglobin in blood. Total hemoglobin mass is derived by multiplication with the molar weight of hemoglobin. CO rebreathing has been used for {\textbackslash}textgreater100 yr and has undergone steady improvement so that today excellent values in terms of accuracy and precision can be achieved if the methodological precautions are carefully followed.},

In exercise and sports-science research and routine testing, internal validity is commonly achieved by controlling variables such as exercise and warm-up protocols, prior training, nutritional intake before testing, ambient temperature, time of testing, hours of sleep, age, and gender. However, a number of other potential confounding variables often do not receive adequate attention in sports physiology and performance research. These confounding variables include instructions on how to perform the test, volume and frequency of verbal encouragement, knowledge of exercise endpoint, number and gender of observers in the room, influence of music played before and during testing, and the effects of mental fatigue on performance. In this review the authors discuss these variables in relation to common testing environments in exercise and sports science and present some recommendations with the goal of reducing possible threats to internal validity.},

The culprit is widely held to be poor science: questionable research practices, failure to publish negative results, bad incentives, and even fraud. In this article I argue that the high rate of failed replications is consistent with high-quality science. We would expect this outcome if the field of science in question produces a high proportion of false hypotheses prior to testing. If most of the hypotheses under test are false, then there will be many false hypotheses that are apparently supported by the outcomes of well conducted experiments and null hypothesis significance tests with a type-I error rate (α) of 5\%. Failure to recognize this is to commit the fallacy of ignoring the base rate. I argue that this is a plausible diagnosis of the replication crisis and examine what lessons we thereby learn for the future conduct of science.},
